    description: "FITAR is a smartphone app that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to help gym-goers understand exercises better. It offers customizable workout plans, letting users easily pick exercises for each session. This makes planning workouts simple. The app shows a life-sized virtual humanoid demonstrating exercises right on your phone screen. Users can watch these exercises from various angles in real-time. This feature helps in maintaining proper form and preventing injuries. It's like having a personal trainer available 24/7 through AR. Additionally, users can rate the exercises and workout plans, providing valuable feedback and personalizing their fitness journey.",
