We created an affinity diagram to pinpoint issues in the complex menu and developed a prototype in Figma. Our design emphasized usability, and we worked closely with The Document Foundation using their resources, like a whiteboard, for effective categorization.

Each test session was led by a moderator responsible for task distribution and communication, while two observers silently monitored the proceedings. Our assessment covered 11 tasks related to site navigation, information retrieval, property management, and application form completion, all relevant to a studentâ€™s housing search. We identified 22 usability issues, rated on a severity scale from 1 (critical) to 4 (cosmetic), with most problems being significant or minor usability issues. Despite testers initially having a good impression of the site, it was ultimately perceived as somewhat illogical and cumbersome. The housing foundation, TOAS, was very pleased with the thoroughness and insights of our work, rewarding our efforts with movie tickets, a gesture that highlighted their appreciation of our contribution to improving their website's user experience.",

We observed that many restaurants don't actively collect on-site feedback, and customers often hesitate to voice concerns directly. To address this, we proposed an online feedback system embedded in the restaurant's website, enabling honest post-meal reviews. Our design counters the aggressive tactics seen in current systems, like persistent pop-ups on delivery sites, which can discourage genuine feedback. We also considered the lack of incentives in existing systems; a complicated or unrewarding process might lead to less thoughtful responses. By simplifying the feedback process and integrating it seamlessly into the restaurant's existing online presence, we aimed to make the system beneficial for both customers and restaurants. This approach would encourage honest feedback, making customers feel their opinions are valued and helping restaurants improve their service and offerings.",

    description: "In our four-person team, we developed a futuristic smart voice assistant, focusing on enhancing the interaction with smart home devices. This project, rooted in extensive background research, involved expanding on existing speech command technologies while infusing substantial user customization options. Our approach was inspired by current solutions, but we aimed to introduce innovative concepts and features that cater to future needs. Central to our design was the improvement of user experience, especially for those with mobility impairments, achieved through natural language processing and intuitive controls. This assistant not only offered hands-free convenience for busy individuals but also integrated seamlessly with other smart home technologies. Our efforts culminated in creating a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly smart home environment, demonstrating our commitment to pushing the boundaries of auditory interaction in smart technology.",

    description: "FitnessBPM, an innovative solo project, is a highly gamified application that transforms fitness tracking into an engaging experience. Using a smart ring or watch, it tracks the user's beats per minute (BPM) and converts this data into experience points (EXP) within the app. The design, developed through extensive background research, includes setting various fitness goals and providing personalized challenges and suggestions. Its gamifying elements are chosen for their effectiveness in motivating and engaging users, while also promoting group activities. The app features levels, challenges, achievements, and badges to reward progress and encourage continued use. Creating FitnessBPM was an enjoyable journey; I crafted interactive designs using Figma, conducted UX testing on the prototype, and made iterative improvements based on user feedback. This project showcases my commitment to combining fitness with fun and community through thoughtful and user-centric design.",
