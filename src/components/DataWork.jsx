    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reading Data from ARuCo Markers:</strong> The app can understand special markers to create augmented reality effects.</li>
      <li><strong>Generating Augmented Content:</strong> It can make digital images appear in specific places in real-time.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera Calibration:</strong> Adjusting the camera for a more reliable and accurate AR experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h3>üíª Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unity and C#:</strong> Main tools for building the app, chosen for their power and because I wanted to get better at using them.</li>
      <li><strong>SourceTree for Version Control:</strong> Keeping track of changes and updates to the project easily.</li>
